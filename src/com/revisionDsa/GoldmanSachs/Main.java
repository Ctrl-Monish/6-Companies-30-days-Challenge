    ques 1.) Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams.
    The groups must be created in order of their appearance in the original array.
    Look at the sample case for clarification.
    Input:
        N = 5
        words[] = {act,god,cat,dog,tac}
        Output:
        god dog
        act cat tac
        Explanation:
        There are 2 groups of
        anagrams "god", "dog" make group 1.
        "act", "cat", "tac" make group 2.
